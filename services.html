						<span>This style is slowly replacing the strict office dress code. Our modern hectic lifestyle is usually a little harsh and does not even let a businessman have the luxury and satisfaction of wearing strictly classic suits. Then comes the question – What shall we wear for work? Casual wear has become an excellent solution for such problems. Casual wear allows you to looks stylish and appropriate, in your office and in other places..</span>
						<ul>

								<p>
									Casual wear is a style which consists of many different kinds of dress – Jackets, trousers and shirts which are closer to classic style as well as Jeans and leather jackets.
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Classic casual style – this is trousers, shirt, pull-over with V-shaped cut and a jacket. All these items remind us of the classic suit by their looks, but differ not highly pretentious and formal. They are usually made of practical materials, and wearing them for long periods is easy and comfortable. This type of dress should certainly be included in a man's wardrobe.

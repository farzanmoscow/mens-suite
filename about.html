					I am Sammy Kotwani, the founder of "The Imperial Tailoring Co." I grew up in a world of fashion. I
					started my career back in India already in my adolescence. Then I joined in the institute of silk
					and serigraphy under the scientific association of SASMIRA – one of the most prestigious institutes
					of India. I obtained DMTT (Diploma in man-made textile technology) and DMST (Diploma in Man-made
					spinning technology) from there. After a few years, being deeply impressed by the English fashion,
					continued my learning process in the best designing schools of London for a few years. I started
					working under the best tailors, who specialize in bespoke tailoring in London. I had a lot of
					clients from different corners of the world.
				</p>
				<br>

				<p>
					In 1990, I was in Belgium when I met with a partner of "Ernst&Young". He told me that in the future
					Moscow will present an excellent opportunity for business such as ours, and advised me to not
					deviate from my course and concentrate on making just custom-made suits for men. "If you make a
					place for you in the heart of Moscow,you'll stay there for ever", this is what he said.


				</p>
				<hr>

				<p>
					In 1991, I started the company "Wintex International" and sold bespoke suits in embassies for
					diplomats and foreign businessmen in Moscow. In those days, 90% of our clients were foreigners. In
					1994,my younger brother Jimmy joined me in Moscow, then my youngest brother Andy followed his steps
					in 1995, after finishing his studies
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The financial crisis of 1998 made us lose a lot of clients. We had to make a new business plan to
					survive. Then we thought – Why should we specialise only on foreign clients, when we live in this
					city? That is how we changed our strategy and started the fight for Russian clients. That is how
					"The Imperial Tailoring Co." was born.
